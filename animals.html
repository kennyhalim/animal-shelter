<p>
  A quiet and curious 5-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix! Maggie-potomus lives up to her name well with the exact coloring of a baby hippo and she makes an adorable snuffle sound when sniffing the ground. She loves playing with her squeaky toys, having her back scratched, and being petted, of course!
  Maggie would do best in a mellow, loving home. She will need to maintain her grain-free diet and daily exercise to continue feeling and looking like her best self. Come meet your new best furry friend, Maggie-potomus, today!

  Meet Casper, a 9-year-old Beagle! Casper is a very sweet and mellow boy who loves to sniff and walks great on a leash.
  He also knows a few commands and will happily sit for a treat.
  His treat motivation makes it really easy to give him his daily medication. Casper seems to enjoy the other dogs he has met while staying with us and loved spending time with his foster dog siblings. He's a total charmer with a wonderful Beagle personality and will likely do well in any home. Please read Casper's glowing foster report from his adoring foster family!
